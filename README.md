# datr

Converts DATR theory to KATR and runs it.

'make create' will create the container using a singularity "build from def file" command

'make run' starts a python web server on the localhost at port 8000

Access the main project page at localhost:8000/cgi-bin/datr.cgi in your browser of choice
